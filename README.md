- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichelleNickel
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things, so i try to take it one step at a time exploring all of the possibilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Webdevelopment and i am excited to see what i will be able to do, once i get comfortable enough.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate on something right now, but if you are interested you can leave me a message :)
- 📫 How to reach me... not sure if i want to post my email or anything private yet... let's see how this goes first
